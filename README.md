# TCP SOCKET WEB

### **OVERVIEW**

In this programming task, the fundamental principles of socket programming for TCP connections in Python were explored. This encompassed the creation of a socket, binding it to a specific address and port, and handling HTTP packets. Additionally, insights into the HTTP header format were gained.

The primary objective of this project was to construct a straightforward web server with the ability to process one HTTP request at a time.

In cases where the requested file was not found on the server, the server was programmed to send an "HTTP 404 Not Found" message to the client.
